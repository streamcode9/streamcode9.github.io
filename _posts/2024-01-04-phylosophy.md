* Escapism
* Learn by doing
* Doing something poorly today is better than doing something well but never.
* The point of learning new framework  is not to accomplish something with it, but rather to engage in deliberate practice to understand its limitations as a technology. But if you’re coding just for the sake of it without producing anything tangible, it’s a waste of time—there should be artifacts of your efforts left behind.
* 3x5 why analysis
* Deliberate practice
  * Read -> practice (physical or mental) -> repet => knowledge * experience
  * Dedication - 40h per week trainings.
  * Mental training - imagine all possible situations and your actions
  * Analyze past situations. What was done bad? What can be done better?
  * Analyze possible solutions -> make decision -> retro -> repeat => decision making experience
  * This is also part of deliberate practice, where new skills are considered not separately, but in connection with all other skills.
* You don't stop learning
  because you grow old.
  You grow old
  because you stop learning
  - R. Feynman
