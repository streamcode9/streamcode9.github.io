* Escapism
* Education = dedication
  * Learn by doing
* Doing something poorly today is better than doing something well but never.
* The point of learning new framework  is not to accomplish something with it, but rather to engage in deliberate practice to understand its limitations as a technology. But if you’re coding just for the sake of it without producing anything tangible, it’s a waste of time—there should be artifacts of your efforts left behind.
* 3x5 why analysis
* Deliberate practice
  * Mental training - imagine all possible situations and your actions
  * Analyze possible solutions -> make decision -> retro -> repeat => decision making experience
  * New skills are considered not separately, but in connection with all other skills
  * Knowledge of a few principles relieves the need to know many facts
  * Accordingly, if you learn a general principle, you should eliminate redundancy in your mind to make room for more information
  * Study what you use constantly
  * Replace specific knowledge that you use constantly with general knowledge of the same kind
* You don't stop learning
  because you grow old.
  You grow old
  because you stop learning
  - R. Feynman
