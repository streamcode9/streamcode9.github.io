The idea behind **Pauper** is simple but brilliant:  
**"Only common cards allowed."**

---

### **Core Concept:**
Pauper is a Magic: The Gathering format where you can only use cards that have been printed at **common rarity** in at least one official MTG set (paper or online).

---

### **Why It Exists:**

- **Budget-Friendly:** Most commons are cheap or free, so you can build full decks for $10–50.
- **Skill-Based:** Without expensive mythics or rares, gameplay emphasizes **efficiency, timing, and deck synergy.**
- **Accessible:** Great for new players or those who want a competitive format without spending much.
- **Community-Driven:** It began as a fan format but became officially recognized by Wizards of the Coast.

---

### **Rules Snapshot:**

- **60-card decks (or 100 in Commander variant)**
- **Sideboard:** 15 cards (for 1v1 constructed)
- **Card legality:** Any card printed at **common rarity** in a paper or MTGO-legal set.
- **Ban list:** A few overpowered commons are banned (like *Gitaxian Probe*, *Sinkhole*, etc.)

---

### **Gameplay Style:**
- Fast, tight, interactive.
- Features lots of **efficient spells**, **combat tricks**, and **card advantage loops**.
- Archetypes include **aggro**, **midrange**, **control**, and even **combo**.

### **1. Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO) – Best Option**
- **Pauper is an official format** on MTGO with a large player base.
- You can build Pauper decks and play against real players or **AI bots (solitaire/test mode)**.
- Decks can be rented or built very cheaply.
- **Not free**, but affordable — especially for Pauper.

---

### **2. Forge (Free, Open Source)**
- A fan-made MTG client for **offline play vs AI**.
- Supports Pauper and tons of other formats.
- Has deck-building tools and thousands of cards, including commons.
- Not officially supported by Wizards, but very popular for solo play.

---

### **3. Cockatrice + Pauper Decks**
- Free tool for playing MTG (mostly with friends or self-testing).
- No AI, but you can goldfish (test your deck without an opponent).
- Good for building and learning Pauper decks.

---

### **4. MTG Arena – Limited Pauper Play**
- **No dedicated Pauper format**, but:
  - You can build "Pauper-like" decks using commons.
  - Use "Play" mode vs bots or in casual matches with friends.
  - Doesn't support all Pauper-legal cards because the card pool is smaller.

---

### TL;DR:
- **Best full experience vs AI:** **Forge (free)** or **MTGO (cheap but official)**.
- **Arena:** Possible, but not true Pauper.
