### Philosophy and Methods
* [Scientific Method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) (Systematic approaches to scientific inquiry)
* [TRIZ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) (Theory of inventive problem solving)
* Critical Thinking (Evaluation of arguments and evidence)
* Humanism
* Education = dedication
  * Learn by doing
  * You don't stop learning
    because you grow old.
    You grow old
    because you stop learning
    - R. Feynman
  * 3x5 why analysis
* Deliberate practice
  * Simulation modeling
  * Doing something poorly today is better than doing something well but never.
  * The point of learning new framework  is not to accomplish something with it, but rather to engage in deliberate practice to understand its limitations as a technology. But if you’re coding just for the sake of it without producing anything tangible, it’s a waste of time—there should be artifacts of your efforts left behind.
  * New skills are considered not separately, but in connection with all other skills
  * Knowledge of a few principles relieves the need to know many facts
  * Accordingly, if you learn a general principle, you should eliminate redundancy in your mind to make room for more information
  * Study what you use constantly
  * Replace specific knowledge that you use constantly with general knowledge of the same kind
