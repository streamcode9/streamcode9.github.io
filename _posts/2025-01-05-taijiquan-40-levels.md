## **KEY CONCEPTS EXPLAINED**

### **Silk Reeling (Chan Si Jin)**  
Spiral energy generated from the ground up through coordinated, circular, and connected movements. It trains whole-body power, balance, and qi flow.

### **Fajin**  
Explosive release of energy. Not muscular but a sudden release of stored elastic energy through correct structure and intent. Starts from the Dantian, transmitted through a relaxed body.

### **Root (Gen)**  
Sinking your center of gravity, maintaining stable connection to the ground. Enables power transmission and absorption.
