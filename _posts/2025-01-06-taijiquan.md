## Term
Taijiquan - is an ancient Chinese martial art. Initially developed for combat and self-defense, for most practitioners it has evolved into a sport and form of exercise.

Учение тайцзи (тайцзицюань, 太极拳) основано на принципах гармонии, баланса и естественного движения.
Его суть заключается в объединении тела, разума и энергии (ци, 气) через плавные, непрерывные движения и медитативное состояние.  

Основные аспекты тайцзи:  
1. **Принцип инь и ян** – все движения построены на чередовании мягкости и твердости, расслабления и напряжения, покоя и движения.  
2. **Циркуляция энергии (ци)** – правильное дыхание и плавные движения способствуют свободному потоку энергии в теле.  
3. **Единство тела и сознания** – практика требует сосредоточенности, медитативного состояния и контроля над движением.  
4. **Боевое искусство** – изначально тайцзи развивалось как стиль ушу, включающий принципы мягкости против жесткости, использование силы противника против него самого.  
5. **Оздоровительный аспект** – регулярная практика укрепляет здоровье, улучшает координацию, гибкость и помогает в борьбе со стрессом.  

Тайцзи можно рассматривать и как боевое искусство, и как форму оздоровительной гимнастики, но его главная цель – достижение гармонии внутри себя и с окружающим миром.

Chen Fa Ke, 17 th generation (1887 - 1957) Master Chen Fake was the 17th generation lineage holder of Chen Style Tai Chi Chuan. The Chen family style is the oldest and the original form of tai chi chuan on which all other styles are based. Master Chen Fake was the great grandson of the famous grandmaster Chen Changxing, his grandfather was Chen Genyun and his father Chen Yangxi were also well known Tai Chi Masters. Master Chen Fake taught for many years in Beijing he and his nephew were the first Chen family members to openly teach Chen Style giving public classes in Beijing in the late 1920s. His lasting legacy has been to make this style a distinct entity in the creation of the New Frame (xin jia), Chen Fake feared that Taijiquan was being lost because some of its properties were too subtle, so he added external movement to internal actions. Due much to his efforts he has managed to raise the awareness of this form spreading it to a world audience. Today Chen Style Tai Chi Chuan is the third most popular form practiced throughout the world.

Chen Zhao Kui, 18th generation (1928 - 1981) Grandmaster Chen Zhao Kui was the youngest son of the 17th generation Grandmaster Chen Fa Ke (pronounced fah-kuh). He went to Peiping (now called Beijing) with his father when he was only 4 years old. He started to learn Tai Chi Chuan from his father when he was 7. Under his father’s strict training his skill improved impressively. When he was only 13 he once fought with a dozen youngsters in school and he tossed them around like rag dolls. After he graduated from the Zhicheng high school in Beijing he could not continue his education due to financial hardship. He stayed home and practiced martial arts full time. Later, Chen got a job with the 5th Construction Company. He practiced Tai Chi very hard day and night. He once told his students that if they wanted to succeed they needed to work harder than an average person. His philosophy was that whatever one does, be it Tai Chi or any other endeavor, one must work very hard. This is what he said to his students: “If you have time to practice, then practice as hard as you can; if you do not have time to practice, then squeeze out some time to practice even if it is only a few minutes.”

Chen Yu, 19th generation, only son of Chen Zhao Kui. He started study with his father at the age of 7 and has gongfu that most closely resembles his father's as he is the one who stayed with, cooked for, and traveled with his father. His gongfu is painful to practice, and painful to receive. The emphasis is on body connection and development of practical internal power. His body method is like a wave that rolls through the body ending in an explosion. He is not world famous and has kept to himself practicing and working for years, but in martial arts circles in China, he is known to have powerful expression (Fa Jin) and furious Qin Na capabilities. He can literally express power with any technique at any point. He is one of very few living Taiji quan practitioners with the higest level of development. He has a big heart and is a very generous teacher as well.

ButIn in 2004 he began serious study of Chen Family TaijiQuan by Grandmaster Chen Yu. Now he improve a lots in all of disciplines in Chen Style, in 2010 Master Chen You was very happy  when he watched Yi Lu and Are Lu from him.
