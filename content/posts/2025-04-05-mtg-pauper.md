The idea behind **Pauper** is simple but brilliant:  
**"Only common cards allowed."**

---

### **Core Concept:**
Pauper is a Magic: The Gathering format where you can only use cards that have been printed at **common rarity** in at least one official MTG set (paper or online).

---

### **Why It Exists:**

- **Budget-Friendly:** Most commons are cheap or free, so you can build full decks for $10–50.
- **Skill-Based:** Without expensive mythics or rares, gameplay emphasizes **efficiency, timing, and deck synergy.**
- **Accessible:** Great for new players or those who want a competitive format without spending much.
- **Community-Driven:** It began as a fan format but became officially recognized by Wizards of the Coast.

---

### **Rules Snapshot:**

- **60-card decks (or 100 in Commander variant)**
- **Sideboard:** 15 cards (for 1v1 constructed)
- **Card legality:** Any card printed at **common rarity** in a paper or MTGO-legal set.
- **Ban list:** A few overpowered commons are banned (like *Gitaxian Probe*, *Sinkhole*, etc.)

---

### **Gameplay Style:**
- Fast, tight, interactive.
- Features lots of **efficient spells**, **combat tricks**, and **card advantage loops**.
- Archetypes include **aggro**, **midrange**, **control**, and even **combo**.

---


---

### **1. Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO) – Best Option**
- **Pauper is an official format** on MTGO with a large player base.
- You can build Pauper decks and play against real players or **AI bots (solitaire/test mode)**.
- Decks can be rented or built very cheaply.
- **Not free**, but affordable — especially for Pauper.

---

### **2. Forge (Free, Open Source)**
- A fan-made MTG client for **offline play vs AI**.
- Supports Pauper and tons of other formats.
- Has deck-building tools and thousands of cards, including commons.
- Not officially supported by Wizards, but very popular for solo play.

---

### **3. Cockatrice + Pauper Decks**
- Free tool for playing MTG (mostly with friends or self-testing).
- No AI, but you can goldfish (test your deck without an opponent).
- Good for building and learning Pauper decks.

---

### **4. MTG Arena – Limited Pauper Play**
- **No dedicated Pauper format**, but:
  - You can build "Pauper-like" decks using commons.
  - Use "Play" mode vs bots or in casual matches with friends.
  - Doesn't support all Pauper-legal cards because the card pool is smaller.

---

### TL;DR:
- **Best full experience vs AI:** **Forge (free)** or **MTGO (cheap but official)**.
- **Arena:** Possible, but not true

### Level 1: Getting Started with Pauper
**Goal**: Understand Pauper basics and set up on MTGO.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Pauper format rules: Only Common-rarity cards allowed (based on legality in any Magic set’s Common printing).  
- MTGO interface: Navigating the client, joining games, and building decks.  
- Budget-friendly deckbuilding: Pauper’s low-cost appeal (decks often cost 10–100 tix).  

**Steps**:  
1. Install MTGO and create an account. Explore the “Play Lobby” and “Collection” tabs.  
2. Read the official Pauper format rules on Wizards’ website or MTG’s Pauper page.  
3. Watch a beginner’s MTGO tutorial (e.g., YouTube channels like Tolarian Community College).  
4. Rent or buy a budget deck (5–10 tix) from a rental service like Cardhoarder or Manatraders, or purchase a starter deck like Mono-Red Burn.  
5. Play 5–10 casual games in the “Open Play” lobby to get comfortable with MTGO’s controls.

### Level 2: Learning Your First Deck
**Goal**: Master the mechanics and strategy of one Pauper deck.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Deck archetypes: Aggro (e.g., Burn), Control (e.g., Dimir Control), Midrange (e.g., Boros Synthesizer), Combo (e.g., Walls Combo).  
- Mana curve and synergy: How cards work together to execute a game plan.  
- Sideboarding basics: Adjusting your deck for specific matchups.  

**Steps**:  
1. Choose a beginner-friendly deck (e.g., Mono-Red Burn or Mono-Blue Delver). Check decklists on mtggoldfish.com or mtgtop8.com.  
2. Study a deck guide or watch gameplay videos (e.g., from streamers like SnapBolt or LSV) to understand card roles and win conditions.  
3. Play 20 games in the “Tournament Practice” room, focusing on your deck’s core strategy (e.g., for Burn: deal damage fast, use removal sparingly).  
4. Learn to sideboard by reviewing matchup guides for your deck (e.g., what to swap vs. Control decks).  
5. Track your wins/losses and note one mistake per game to improve (e.g., “Forgot to cast Bolt before combat”).

**Steps**:  
1. Browse recent Pauper tournament results on mtggoldfish.com or mtgo.com to identify top decks.  
2. Play 20 games in the “Tournament Practice” room, noting the decks you face and their key cards (e.g., Gurmag Angler in Dimir).  
3. Read a Pauper meta overview (e.g., from ChannelFireball or PureMTGO).  
4. Learn 3–5 staple cards per color (e.g., Blue: Counterspell, Preordain; Red: Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning).  
5. Write a short summary of how your deck wins or loses against 3 meta decks (e.g., Burn vs. Affinity: race them, remove key creatures).

### Level 4: Improving Game Mechanics
**Goal**: Enhance technical play and decision-making.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Combat math: Calculating damage, blockers, and trades.  
- Stack interactions: How instants and abilities resolve.  
- Mana efficiency: Using all available mana each turn when possible.  

**Steps**:  
1. Watch a Pauper gameplay video focusing on tight play (e.g., Aspiringspike or AnarchistAbe on Twitch). Pause and predict their plays.  
2. Play 20 games, focusing on one mechanic per session (e.g., Session 1: Combat math—calculate lethal before attacking).  
3. Practice using MTGO’s hotkeys (e.g., F2 to pass priority, F6 to pass turn) to speed up play.  
4. Review 3 games where you lost, identifying at least one mechanical error (e.g., “Missed a trigger” or “Tapped mana incorrectly”).  
5. Complete an MTG rules quiz online (e.g., via JudgeApps or a rules blog) to solidify stack and combat knowledge.

### Level 5: Deckbuilding Basics
**Goal**: Build and tweak your own Pauper deck.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Deck construction: 60 cards (40 spells, 20 lands as a baseline), balancing creatures, spells, and mana.  
- Card evaluation: Power/toughness, mana cost, and synergy.  
- Testing and tuning: Iterating based on performance.  

**Steps**:  
1. Pick an archetype you enjoy (e.g., Midrange). Find a sample decklist and note its key cards and mana base.  
2. Build a deck in MTGO using your collection or a rental service, sticking to a 60-card minimum.  
3. Play 15 games with your deck in “Tournament Practice,” tracking what works (e.g., “Card X always feels strong”) and what doesn’t.  
4. Swap 3–5 cards based on testing (e.g., replace a high-cost card with a cheaper alternative).  
5. Post your decklist on a Pauper forum (e.g., Reddit’s r/Pauper or MTG Salvation) for feedback, then make one change based on advice.

### Notes
- **Progression**: Each level builds on the last. Spend 1–3 weeks per level, depending on playtime (e.g., 5–10 hours/week).  
- **Resources**: Use mtggoldfish.com, mtgtop8.com, and puremtgo.com for decklists and meta updates. Follow Pauper streamers like SnapBolt, AnarchistAbe, or Deluxeicoff for live learning.  
- **Budget**: Pauper is affordable, but renting decks via Cardhoarder or Manatraders (5–10 tix/month) can expand your options.  
- **Tracking**: Keep a log of games, win rates, and lessons learned to monitor improvement.
